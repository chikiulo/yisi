A Republican strategy to counter the re - election of Obama
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
However , the Brennan Centre considers this a myth , stating that electoral fraud is rarer in the United States than the number of people killed by lightning .
Indeed , Republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in a decade .
One thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turn - out .
In this sense , the measures will partially undermine the American democratic system .
Unlike in Canada , the American States are responsible for the organisation of federal elections in the United States .
It is in this spirit that a majority of American governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult .
This phenomenon gained momentum following the November 2010 elections , which saw 675 new Republican representatives added in 26 States .
As a result , 180 bills restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 States were introduced in 2011 alone .
